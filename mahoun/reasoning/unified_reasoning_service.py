Unified Reasoning Service
=========================

Combines symbolic FOL reasoning with neural reasoning for comprehensive AI reasoning.

Architecture:
- Symbolic Layer: reasoning_logic/ (FOL, Rete, Unification)
- Neural Layer: mahoun/reasoning/ (LLM, CoT, Causal)
- Unified API: Single interface for all reasoning tasks
- **GUARDRAILS**: Cross-validation between symbolic and neural layers

Features:
- Hybrid reasoning (symbolic + neural)
- Automatic mode selection
- Fallback mechanisms
- Performance optimization
- Audit trails
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Neural outputs validated by symbolic layer
